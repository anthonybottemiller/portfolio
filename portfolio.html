      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>I am an individual that arrived at the doorstep of Web development from supporting users of all types of computers with their technical issues. I have <strong>vast experience in troubleshooting and communicating solutions</strong>. I have had a strong interest in technology my entire life. I have decided to pursue programming after realizing that I am capable of more than merely maintaining computer and networking systems.</p>

      <h2>Interests</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Science/Technology</h3>
          <p>I have a strong general interest in <strong>science and technology</strong>. I enjoy keeping up with releases of computer hardware. I also enjoy reading about the latest scientific advancments in journals or websites.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Camping</h3>
          <p>Technology is great but sometimes a change of pace is required. I can think of no better contrast to my profesional interests than getting away from the screens and to the <strong>great outdoors</strong>!</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Music</h3>
          <p>Ever since I was young I have had a <strong>very special relationship with music</strong>. Starting with the Portland Symphonic Boys Choir in my youth I have consistently been involved in performing music. Collaborating creatively with a group of individuals on works that are so deeply tied to emotions is a reward that is difficult to match.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>People</h3>
          <p><strong>I find people in their nearly infinite variety and potential extremely fascinating</strong>. Whether studying a culture that I am not familiar with. Or getting to know someone new for the first time. I find that people are never boring.</p>
